# highlight-css-color package

### unmaintained - I'd like to fix this package up but over the past year Atom has made it incredibly obtuse to hack on a package. I have no interest in working on it anymore. 

Highlights CSS color values (#fff, rgba(25,25,25,0.25), etc.) with their actual
color value.
